## Background
For my university master course Software Applications with Artificial Intelligence, I received a dataset of resumes from the company msg. We have string data of resumes and annotations for different types of named entities.

## Objective
This project aims to use spacy and flair to predict the named entities such as skills, degrees or companies worked at in a novel resume. This makes the online processing of resume way easier if an automated entity recognition system can detect such entities.
